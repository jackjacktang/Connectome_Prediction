# Connectome Prediction Repository

## Connectome
Connectome is a map of neural connections or pathways in the brain which can be derived from Diffusion-weighted Imaging. It is usually represented as an adjacency matrix where each edge represents the connection strength between two brain regions. The study of connectomes can help us to understand brain function and diseases
